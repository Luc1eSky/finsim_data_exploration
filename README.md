## FinSim Game Data Exploration and Visualizations

The R notebook: FinSim_data_visualization_examples in this repo explores a cleaned dataset derived from the FinSim Game, a digital simulation game designed to teach financial literacy to microcredit borrowers in low-income countries. The data was collected during a randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted between June 6, 2023, and July 29, 2023, in four districts of central and eastern Uganda.

Data Source:
A detailed explanation of the data source and variables can be found in the read_me_game_data.Rmd file.

Data Description:
The dataset captures user activity within the FinSim Game, including details regarding participant progress, decision-making processes, and corresponding outcomes.
The data comprises a total of 117,950 decision entries made by 133 unique participants.

Context:
The FinSim Game was developed by Development Economics students at the University of San Francisco as part of the IDEC (International and Development Economics) program. The R notebook investigates the cleaned dataset to gain insights into user behavior and learning outcomes within the game.

Project Repository:
The complete project, including the R notebook and potentially other relevant files, can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/Luc1eSky/financial_literacy_game

Note:
This readme assumes the R notebook and the data file (read_me_game_data.Rmd and data source: UG_cleaned_game_data.csv) are stored in the same repository. You might need to adjust the file paths if the data is located elsewhere.
